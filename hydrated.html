		<p>Have you ever felt thristy after a long exhausting hot day or after a tiring workout? During that moment, you would most likely be willing to drink anything. During these tempting times, if water is one of your options, it is best to choose it. Water is a good choice of beverage and is usually what people choose to drink when exercising. In order to stay hydrated and restore fluid while exercising, drink water prior to, during, and after exercising. The reason behind this is, sugar substitutes are mixed into sports drinks in replacement of sugar which is just as bad. Furthermore, drinking sugary drinks can negatively affect your health. Consuming sugary drinks can lead to higher risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cavities in children.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind, even if there is a drink not included in the list above, it does not mean it is a healthy option. Be mindful when you are out and when you are in a situation where you are likely to consume a sweetened drink. For example, when you are at a party, playing a sport, thirsty, going for a run, and choosing a side beverage to compliment your meal, pick water.</p>
