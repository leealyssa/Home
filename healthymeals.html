		<h1>Limiting Unhealthy Foods and Eating Healthy Meals</h1>

		<p>Some people underestimate the importance of how eating certain types of foods play a crucial role in your everyday life. The first rule to know when starting your fitness journey is, make sure you eat breakfast everyday and have healthy nutritious meals. Rather than choosing foods with fat, sugar, and calories, pick foods with more protein and fibre. You don&rsquo;t need additional food to make up for mild or moderate quantities of physical activity. Listen to your body to figure out how much food you should consume.</p>
		<h2>Certain foods and drinks are advertised to help increase your sports performance such as:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Energy Gels</li>
			<li>Sports Drinks</li>
			<li>Protein Powders</li>
			<li>Performance Bars</li>
		</ul>
